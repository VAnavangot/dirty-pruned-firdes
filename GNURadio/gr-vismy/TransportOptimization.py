    """!
    Intention  of the block is to perform transport of sparse representation to the filter coefficients with larger absolute deviation from the filter coefficients with small or low absolute deviation

    IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION: We have a nearly uniform sparse representation accross all filter coefficients
